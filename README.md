## Glassmorphic Editor Icons
Glassmorphic Editor Icons is a set of Vim and Emacs icon assets based on glassmorphism.
It includes 8 icon patterns:
- Light and dark themes
- Vim and Emacs
- With rounded and unrounded corners

## Devs
These icons were edited using Inkscape, and their original files are saved in Inkscape SVG format in the `inkscape-devs` directory.

`./svg/*.svg` are SVG-formatted icons manually exported from Inkscape for each icon.
`./pngs/*.png` are 1024x1024 PNG-formatted icons manually exported from Inkscape for each icon. Additionally, subdirectories within the `./pngs` directory contain scaled-down versions of each icon. These scaled-down icons were automatically generated using `Imagemagick` via `png-generate.sh`.
